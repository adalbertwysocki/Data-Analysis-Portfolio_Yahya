Data Project 1: Stock Market Analysis

In this portfolio project we will be looking at data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We will use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!
We'll be answering the following questions along the way: 1) What was the change in price of the stock over time? 2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average? 3) What was the moving average of the various stocks? 4) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices? 5) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock? 6) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?

Data Project 2: 2016 Presidential Election Data Analysis - Polls and Donors

In this Data Project we will be looking at data from the 2016 election.
In this project we will analyze two datasets. The first data set will be the results of political polls. We will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions: 1) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation? 2) Did the poll results favor Clinton or Trump? 3) How do undecided voters effect the poll? 4) Can we account for the undecided voters? 5) How did voter sentiment change over time? 6) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

The second questions we will be trying to answer while looking at donor Data set is:

1.) How much was donated and what was the average donation?
2.) How did the donations differ between candidates?
3.) How did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?
4.) What were the demographics of the donors?
5.) Is there a pattern to donation amounts?
