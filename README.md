Data-Project-1---Titanic-Disaster Analysis

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we try to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Data Project 2 - Stock Market Analysis

In this portfolio project we will be looking at data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We will learn how to use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!
We'll be answering the following questions along the way: 1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time? 2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average? 3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks? 4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices? 4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns? 5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock? 6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
